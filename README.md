# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer. Datasets containing ride and city data were used to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types. The Data sets were also used to create a new data frame to find the average fare per week from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types. The dataframe from the analysis was used to create a multiple-line graph that visualized the total weekly fares for each city type for the before mentioned period. The metrics and visualization created was then analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to address any disparities among the city types.

### Results

The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

From this dataframe we can see that Urban cities have the most amount of rides, drivers and rural cities have the least. As a result the city type Urban brings the most revenue as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of revenue. However, as we analyze the Average Fare per Ride column of this dataframe we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning that there is a chance of more revenue in this city type for every ride increase compared to Urban city types which has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

A multiple line chart was also created as follows as part of the analysis to help us visualize and perform analysis of the Total Fares from January 1 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types.

In this time period, the total fare for each of the city type we observe that Urban city type had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We also observe that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. Urban cities also seem to bring a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showing a decline.

#### Summary

Based on the analysis and results after calculating various metrics for each of the city types, here are the recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city type:

•	Urban cities have the highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore account for most of the revenue for the company. As a result this is the best performing city type and more investments should be continued to be made in this type for greater profits for PyBer in the future.

•	Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.

•	The suburban city type is the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be directed towards Urban and Rural city types, as this city type can continue and perform as it is doing currently for PyBer.
